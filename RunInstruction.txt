All the codes are written in C++.Please use g++ compiler to run.
1.addrtrace.cpp  :
Generate machine access traces for given program using PIN tool.
Ex: make obj-intel64/addrtrace.so
    pin -t obj-intel64/addrtrace.so ./prog1 8
We have counted the machine access by processing the above traces.

2.Ass2_Part2.cpp :
Input trace file generated by PIN tool as command line argument and output the access distances and cdf.
Please redirect output to a file.
Ex: g++ Ass2_Part2.cpp 
    ./a.out Part1Traces/addrtrace_prog2 > Part2_Prog2_GraphPoints

3.Ass2_Part3.cpp :
Input trace file generated by PIN tool as command line argument and generate file of Misstrace.
Pass this misstrace as a input to Program 2.
Ex: g++ Ass2_Part3.cpp 
    ./a.out Part1Traces/addrtrace_prog2 //It will generate the MissTrace file

4. Ass2_Part4.cpp :
Input trace file generated by PIN tool as command line argument and outputs the sharing profile of threads.
Ex: g++ Ass2_Part4.cpp 
    ./a.out Part1Traces/addrtrace_prog2
